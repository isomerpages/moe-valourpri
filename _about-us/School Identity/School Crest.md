The red “V” extending upwards symbolises the staff and students of Valour Primary School, filled with passion, courage and confidence, reaching out beyond the school, to the community, nation and the world. 

The book represents knowledge and values upon which staff and students are grounded. 

The shield signifies courage and resilience in the face of challenges and uncertainties that the future may bring. 

The green and the blue shows that the next generation will outdo the one before, taken from the Chinese saying “青出于蓝而胜于蓝“.
