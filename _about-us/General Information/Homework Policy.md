### Homework Policy

1	Purposes of Homework
Homework is an important component of the teaching-learning process. It aims to serve the following purposes. 
a.	stimulate thinking and develop ideas, initiative and creativity;
b.	reinforce and deepen understanding of lessons taught;
c.	allow students to regularly practice, and apply skills and concepts taught;
d.	inculcate responsibility for independent learning and
e.	encourage partnership with parents

2.	Type of Homework
Homework refers to any learning activity that students are required by the school to complete outside of curriculum time. Common examples are:

a.	Practice Exercises
b.	Preparatory Homework
c.	Extension Assignments

3.   Communication with Parents/Guardians
Homework (and class work) provides parents with timely information on the learning progress of their child and opportunity to be involved in the child’s learning. 

•	Homework will be recorded by our students in the Student Planner 
•	Parents are requested to inform the teacher if their children are having difficulty with homework given. 
•	If homework cannot be completed within the estimated duration of time given, do allow some extra time of about 20 mins.  If the homework is still incomplete, the student should offer a valid reason to their teachers.
•	If a student repeatedly fails to do/submit their assigned homework, the teacher will contact the parent.
•	If a student is absent, he/she is responsible for obtaining missed homework assignments from their teachers. 


4.	Good Homework Practices
•	Select a well-lit, comfortable and quiet spot in the home and make it a designated homework area.
•	Ensure that the necessary stationery is available.
•	Establish routine study hours and study habits
•	Encourage child to complete homework given on time.
