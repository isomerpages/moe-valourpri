### Homework Policy

**Purposes of Homework**<br>
Homework is an important component of the teaching-learning process. It aims to serve the following purposes. <br>
a ) stimulate thinking and develop ideas, initiative and creativity;<br>
b )	reinforce and deepen understanding of lessons taught;<br>
c )	allow students to regularly practice, and apply skills and concepts taught;<br>
d )	inculcate responsibility for independent learning and<br>
e )	encourage partnership with parents<br>
<br>
**Type of Homework**<br>
Homework refers to any learning activity that students are required by the school to complete outside of curriculum time. Common examples are:<br>
a ) Practice Exercises<br>
b ) Preparatory Homework<br>
c ) Extension Assignments<br>
<br>
**Communication with Parents/Guardians**<br>
Homework (and class work) provides parents with timely information on the learning progress of their child and opportunity to be involved in the child’s learning. <br>
Homework will be recorded by our students in the Student Planner<br>
* Parents are requested to inform the teacher if their children are having difficulty with homework given.<br>
* If homework cannot be completed within the estimated duration of time given, do allow some extra time of about 20 mins.  If the homework is still incomplete, the student should offer a valid reason to their teachers.<br>
* If a student repeatedly fails to do/submit their assigned homework, the teacher will contact the parent.<br>
* If a student is absent, he/she is responsible for obtaining missed homework assignments from their teachers. <br>


**Good Homework Practices**<br>
* Select a well-lit, comfortable and quiet spot in the home and make it a designated homework area.<br>
* Ensure that the necessary stationery is available.<br>
* Establish routine study hours and study habits<br>
* Encourage child to complete homework given on time.<br>
 
**Timetable Guide for Homework**

* The table below, showing the approximate daily homework duration for students, serves only as a guide. Do take note that actual time required to complete assignments will vary with each child’s study habits and skills.
