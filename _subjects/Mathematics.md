### Focus and Beliefs
The mastery of mathematics concepts and skills will enable our students to be equipped for life. Mathematical problem solving is the heart to mathematics learning. It involves the acquisition and application of mathematics concepts and skills in a wide range of situation, including non-routine, open-ended and real-world problems.

Every Valourian, a creative problem-solver.

Students learn to see that mathematics is all around them - in the classroom, within the school, at home, while doing activities with their family and in and out of school context (e.g., at the supermarket)

Math Week is an interdisciplinary experience which allows our students to see mathematics in authentic settings across other subjects. Through the engaging activities, we relate mathematics to things happening in their everyday life.

**Financial Literacy** <br>
Our financial literacy programme hopes to inculcate in students sound knowledge of managing money. We encourage our students to think critically, creatively and innovatively. We also hope to develop our students to be creative problem-solvers and to have an entrepreneurial mindset.
