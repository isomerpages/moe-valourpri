### Focus and Beliefs

The Aesthetics department in Valour Primary School (VPS) strives to develop students as passionate artists. Through our various visual and performing arts programmes, we aim to develop students’ <br>
1)      awareness and appreciation of the arts in both the local and global cultures. <br>
2)      creative expression and communication through the arts. <br>
3)      performance character

**Art** <br>
The focus of our Art curriculum is for each child to be actively able to see, express and appreciate the value of art.

**Music** <br>
The focus of our Music curriculum is on singing and playing of instruments individually and together as an ensemble.

### Programmes

**Aesthetics Learning Spaces**

Areas in the school are transformed into spaces where teaching and learning can take place for both Art and Music. For example, a cabinet which introduces the artist Piet Mondrain is also used to display sample art pieces and student-made musical instruments.

**Gallery by the Bay**

Situated next to the bus bay, this area is aptly named and spruced up to serve many purposes. It is an area where teaching can take place out of the classroom. Teachers can teach museum gallery etiquette in this area. Students’ art pieces are also displayed here as a form of recognition.

**Aesthetics and Sustainability (Recycling Arts Programme)**

Aligned with our school’s Learning for Life Programme, we incorporate the learning of sustainability and the use of recycled materials to create art pieces for awareness. Our students used recycled bottles, cans and other materials to make usable musical instruments to learn rhythms and timbre in music.

**Primary 3 Ukulele Lessons**

Valourians learn to play a string instrument in Primary 3. Besides learning how to play it individually, they are encouraged to play as a group or as a class to form an ensemble. Values like respect, responsibility and resilience are also emphasised while learning to play or handle a musical instrument.

At the end of the ukulele lesson series, our students would have understood the fundamental functions of the ukulele and will be able to play some basic chord works
