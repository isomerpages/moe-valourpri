### Focus and Belief

**Department Goal** <br>
To provide quality and customised teaching to nurture students’ love of the Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) and their culture.

The learning of the Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) is a lifelong endeavour. The MTL policy seeks to nurture our students to become effective communicators in their mother tongue languages and support them to study their mother tongue languages to as high a level as possible. Having an appreciation of the MTL cultures enhances Singapore’s multicultural identity and fosters social cohesion in our daily lives. In addition, it gives our students a competitive edge when tapping into global or regional opportunities in the future.

The 2015 Primary School MTL curriculum aims to develop students as proficient language users who can communicate in a confident and effective way. The curriculum places greater emphasis on spoken and written interactive skills. Authentic activities will be designed to better develop students’ communication skills.

One can never learn a language without understanding its culture. In Valour Primary School, our students will be exposed to various platforms and learn about the different cultures in Singapore. Such platforms include the Mother Tongue Fortnight, Conversational Chinese and Malay programme, etc.

At the end of six years in Valour Primary School, our students will become confident Mother Tongue Language communicators who are cultured and imbued with traditional values.
