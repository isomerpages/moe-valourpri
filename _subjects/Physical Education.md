### Focus and Beliefs
Physical Education (PE) is about movement - movement that is essential to life, work, and play. The PE programme at Valour Primary School aims to develop our students to have sound fundamental movement skills, a good knowledge of the outdoors and a safety mindset.

Throughout our students’ primary school PE education, we endeavour to provide opportunities for them to experience a variety of physical activities. These physical activities are carefully sequenced to effect the outcomes of the PE syllabus, in an environment where both mastery and achievement are celebrated.

The aim of the Healthy Lifestyle Programme is to bring Valourians together for a dedicated fortnight which focuses on promoting a healthy and active lifestyle through the enactment of physical activities enjoyed together with friends. It is about raising awareness to live and maintain a healthy, active life!

**Sports Carnival**

The annual sports carnival is a culminating event to consolidate the different skills learnt for the year. Our students compete as a class against other classes within their level, scoring points to add to their tally from the Healthy Lifestyle weeks over the year. The winning class is conferred the “Healthy Active Class” of their level, together with a medal to commemorate their victory and effort for the year.

**Healthy Snack Breaks**

Healthy eating is essential for good health, growth and development. Healthy eating in childhood can help to reduce the chances of developing chronic diseases like heart diseases, obesity and type 2 diabetes. Healthy food choices can help our students to maintain a healthy weight, and stay alert and focused in class throughout the day.

We encourage all students to play a part in deciding and packing their own snacks for snack time, and to have balanced meals during recess

The Sports Education Programme (SEP) is a collaborative partnership between Sport Singapore (SportSG) and the Ministry of Education (MOE).
