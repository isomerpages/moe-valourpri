### Importance of Social Studies

Social Studies helps students to attain relevant knowledge and understanding about issues of concern, develop critical and reflective thinking skills, and appreciate multiple perspectives. It also inculcates in students a deeper understanding of the values that define the Singapore society, nurture dispositions that will inspire them to show concern for the society and the world in which they live, and demonstrate empathy in their relationships with others. Through inquiry and authentic learning (e.g., field-based learning and performance tasks), students develop better understanding of the interconnectedness of Singapore and the world they live in, and appreciate the complexities of the human experience.

### The Programme

The Social Studies Programme is aligned to the 2020 Social Studies Primary (SSP) Syllabus and interweaves the school-based CCE programme. It aims to grow Valourians to be informed, concerned and participative citizens, competent in decision-making with an impassioned spirit to contribute responsibly to the society and world they live in, and prepare them for future learning in the humanities and social sciences. 

The programme adopts the three broad clusters of content framed in the 2020 SSP syllabus. These clusters will help our students grow in knowledge (particularly in areas related to self, identity, culture, heritage, people and the environment), develop skills and learn values through examining issues that are of concern to our society and the world in which we live.  The clusters are:

**Cluster 1: Discovering Self and Immediate Environment** <br>
Students will explore who they are and the roles they play in relation to the people and places around them. They will also explore the customs and traditions of some communities in Singapore. Students will not only come to appreciate the cultural diversity in Singapore but also learn how common experiences help unite us as a nation.

**Cluster 2: Understanding Singapore in the Past and Present** <br>
Students will learn about Singapore and the contributions of different groups of people to the country’s growth and independence. They will develop an appreciation of Singapore and come to value the adaptability, resilience and resourcefulness of its leaders and people.

**Cluster 3: Appreciating Singapore, the Region and the World We Live In** <br>
Students will learn about Singapore as a nation and the contributions of different people to its development. They will also develop an understanding of Southeast Asia, Singapore ’s connections with the region as well as legacies of civilisations in the world that can still be seen today.
