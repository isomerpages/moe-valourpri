###  1. PARTICIPATION

1.1          CCA participation is compulsory in Valour Primary School.

1.2         CCAs are open to Primary 3 to 6 students and students are to participate in one CCA.

1.3         To develop CCA-specific knowledge, skills and attitudes progressively, students are strongly encouraged to stay in one CCA from Primary 3 to 6. 

A one-year CCA commitment period is necessary to be considered for a change of CCA.

Applications to change CCA will open at the end of the year.

•              Students are only allowed to apply to change CCA after 1 year.      

•              Students may opt to change their CCA at any time on medical grounds.

•              Changing of CCA is subjected to school’s approval and the availability of vacancies.

1.4         Attendance is compulsory at every CCA session. A medical certificate or a letter from the parent is necessary if the student is absent.

CCA membership and attendance will be reflected in the Report Book.

1.5         P6 students will participate in CCAs only in Semester 1. If students are involved in key competitions held in Semester 2, they will participate in their CCAs until the competitions end.

### 2.COMPETITION

2.1         Sports offered at NSG (Primary) will be recognized as school representation, even if it is not a CCA offered by the school e.g., Taekwondo, Wushu. All other competitions that require school endorsement for participation are to be approved by HOD PE & CCA. 

Students will have to abide by the National School Games (NSG) guidelines if they wish to participate in these competitions via the School Adult Representative (Parent) scheme.

2.2        The school does not encourage Age Dispensation as Age Dispensation is for student-athletes who are **way ahead in the sport and have already attained awards, medals or accolades in their sport.** Requests for Age Dispensation will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis and school will have the final say. 

At Primary 1 and 2, we encourage our students to focus on building the love and foundation for their sport and be ready to participate in competitions that are developmentally appropriate for them come Primary 3.
