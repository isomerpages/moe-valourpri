<h3>P2 CCA Experience</h3>
<p>The purpose of the CCA experience is to help students make sound and responsible
decisions about CCA selection. Primary Two students will select and go
through four different CCA experiences of their choice in Semester 2, 2023.</p>
<p>The CCA experience aims to give students a snippet of how the CCA will
be like if they joined it. This helps to give students a good idea of what
they may expect when they come for CCA sessions weekly.</p>
