The purpose of the CCA experience is to help students make sound and responsible decisions about CCA selection. Primary Two students will select and go through four different CCA experiences of their choice in Semester 2, 2023.

The CCA experience aims to give students a snippet of how the CCA will be like if they joined it. This helps to give students a good idea of what they may expect when they come for CCA sessions weekly.
