### P2 CCA Experience (2023)
The purpose of the CCA experience is to help students make sound and responsible decisions about CCA selection. Primary Two students will select and go through four different CCA experiences of their choice in Semester 2, 2023.

The CCA experience aims to give students a snippet of how the CCA will be like if they joined it. This helps to give students a good idea of what they may expect when they come for CCA sessions weekly.

##### [**Clubs**](/student-development/co-curricular-activities/clubs/)<br>
Clubs allow students to explore and extend their interests in wide ranging and specialised areas which may be knowledge-based or skills-based. Students are honed in information, communication and technical skills as they strive to grow their mastery of the specialised areas.

##### [**Performing Arts**](/student-development/co-curricular-activities/performing-arts/)<br>
Performing Arts instill in students a sense of graciousness and an appreciation for the rich culture and heritage of a multi-racial society.&nbsp;

##### [**Physical Sports**](/student-development/co-curricular-activities/physical-sports/)<br>
Physical Sports develop robustness, fair play and team spirit in students.

##### [**Uniformed Groups**](/student-development/co-curricular-activities/uniformed-groups/)<br>
Uniformed Group activities aim to make good citizens of students by inculcating in them self-reliance, resilience, discipline and a spirit of service to others.
