### Growing Kindness through the Outdoors

Valour Primary School’s Learning for Life Programme (LLP) – **_Growing Kindness through the Outdoors_** – seeks to nurture a sense of wonder and commitment to care for the environment and others. Through it, our students will develop their life skills and socio-emotional competencies, so that they will grow in capability, capacity, courage and resilience, be able to face up to challenges and solve problems on their own and with others.  

Kindness, one of the Valourian Hallmarks, is a key outcome of the programme. As our students learn more about themselves, others and the environment through their outdoor experiences, it is our hope that they will be able to demonstrate kindness to themselves, others and place, wherever they may be.

The LLP programme is offered to all students as part of the school’s six-year holistic curriculum.

Valourians will have the opportunity to go through experiences in the four main categories that the programme is built around – Adventure, Nature-related, Outdoor skills and Sustainability.
