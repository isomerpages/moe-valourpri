### Nature & AdVenture (NAV) @ Valour

Valour Primary School’s Learning for Life Programme (LLP) – NAV @ Valour – focuses on 2 main ideas in how learning in the outdoors will be presented to the students – Nature and Adventure or NAV in short.
The short name of our LLP NAV is a play on the word navigator and the most foundational ability of a navigator is to way find. Our LLP espouses our aim to help the children develop the spirit of the wayfinder.
