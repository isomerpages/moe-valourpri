### Nature &amp; AdVenture (NAV) @ Valour

VValour Primary School’s Learning for Life Programme (LLP) – NAV @ Valour – focuses on 2 main ideas in how learning in the outdoors will be presented to the students – Nature and Adventure or NAV in short. The short name of our LLP, NAV, is a play on the word navigator and the most foundational ability of a navigator is to wayfind. Our LLP espouses our aim to help the children develop the spirit of the wayfinder.

What is the spirit of the wayfinder you might ask? It is the determination and adaptability to find a way through difficult or unknown terrain and situations and the ability to work as a team to learn from one another, support one another and share the responsibility of finding and navigating a “path”. Through the programme, our students will find opportunities to develop life skills and socio-emotional competencies, so that they may grow in capability, capacity, courage and resilience, be able to face up to challenges and solve problems on their own and with others.

The LLP programme is offered to all students as part of the school’s six-year holistic curriculum.
