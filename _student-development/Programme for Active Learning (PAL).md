<center><i> “When children are just beginning school, we need to nurture their desire to learn, to be engaged in and enjoy what they learn, and to develop a sense of competence and confidence.”

 - PAL Resource Guide, 2011 </i></center>
 
School is where children learn to interact and work with other children. The Programme for Active Learning (PAL) with its emphasis on the development of socio-emotional competencies aims to hone each child to be a competent and confident team player who enjoys his lessons and is curious to learn more outside of the classroom. 

In Valour Primary School, the design of PAL modules aims to engage your child through his head, heart and hand. Each module is designed with the following in mind: 
1. Experiential in nature; 
2. Learning in a creative way; 
3. Opportunities for children to create; 
4. Values education and social-emotional learning;
5. Fun and enjoyment 

By the end of the PAL programme, your child would have had exposure and experiences through fun and varied activities in the broad areas of Sports & Games, Outdoor Education, Performing Arts and Visual Arts.
