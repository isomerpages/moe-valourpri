### Programme for Active Learning (PAL)
<center><i> “When children are just beginning school, we need to nurture their desire to learn, to be engaged in and enjoy what they learn, and to develop a sense of competence and confidence.”

&nbsp;- PAL Resource Guide, 2011 </i></center>
 
School is where children learn to interact and work with other children. The Programme for Active Learning (PAL) with its emphasis on the development of socio-emotional competencies aims to hone each child to be a competent and confident team player who enjoys his lessons and is curious to learn more outside of the classroom.&nbsp;

In Valour Primary School, the design of PAL modules aims to engage your child through his head, heart and hand. Each module is designed with the following in mind:&nbsp;
1.&nbsp;Experiential in nature;&nbsp;
2.&nbsp;Learning in a creative way;&nbsp;
3.&nbsp;Opportunities for children to create;&nbsp;
4.&nbsp;Values education and social-emotional learning;
5.&nbsp;Fun and enjoyment&nbsp;

By the end of the PAL programme, your child would have had exposure and experiences through fun and varied activities in the broad areas of Sports &amp; Games, Outdoor Education, Performing Arts and Visual Arts.
