### Character and Citizenship Education
The&nbsp;**Valour Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) Programme**&nbsp;aligns to the 2021 CCE Syllabus (Primary). At its core, it seeks to develop good character, resilience and social-emotional well-being, active citizenship, and future readiness in our students.

Cognisant of a future world that may be fraught with social, economic, geopolitical and environmental challenges, it is of paramount importance to imbue in our students strong character values that will help them face these challenges confidently. In doing so, they will be able to live life purposefully, meaningfully and successfully.&nbsp; To this end, the programme identifies four character qualities undergird by the core values (i.e., respect, responsibility, resilience, integrity, care and harmony) that every Valourian should cultivate. These qualities, also known as the&nbsp;**Valourian Hallmarks**, are&nbsp;**Kindness, Empathy, Grit, Courage and Adaptability**.&nbsp; By developing these qualities, the school believes that every Valourian will become a worthy person of good character, and a concerned and active citizen who cares for the well-being of others and the environment.

The programme focuses on providing students with&nbsp;**experiential and authentic learning**&nbsp;opportunities to acquire, experience, and demonstrate the hallmarks through an integrated and cohesive school-based curriculum that includes both academic and co-curricular domains.
