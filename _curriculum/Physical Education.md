### Focus and Beliefs
At Valour, we believe that Physical Education (PE) is about movement - movement that is essential to life, work, and play. The PE programme at Valour Primary School aims to develop our students to have sound fundamental movement skills, an appreciation of the outdoors and a safety mindset.

Throughout their primary school PE journey, students are given opportunities to experience a wide variety of physical activities and learn skills that they can carry beyond school. These activities are carefully sequenced to support the outcomes of the PE syllabus, and are conducted in an environment where both mastery and achievement are celebrated.

### Programmes
**Healthy Snack Breaks**

An active lifestyle and healthy eating go hand in hand. Healthy eating supports students’ growth, development and focus while reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, obesity and type 2 diabetes. 

Students are encouraged to make healthy food choices by eating nutritious snacks during snack time and having balanced meals during recess.
At Valour, we aim to strengthen partnerships with parents by sharing health-related messages and nutritional guidance to support healthy living beyond the classroom.

**Healthy Lifestyle Programme**

The Healthy Lifestyle Programme brings Valourians together to promote a healthy and active lifestyle. Students engage in a range of physical activities aligned with school-wide themes, such as Racial Harmony Week, enriching their learning experiences while staying active.  

**Sports Education Programme**

The Sports Education Programme (SEP) is a collaborative partnership between Sport Singapore (SportSG) and the Ministry of Education (MOE). At Valour, the programme aims to expose students to sports that they can continue pursuing beyond school as interests and lifelong healthy living activities.

**Sports Carnival**

The annual sports carnival is a highly anticipated event across all levels, providing students with opportunities to showcase the skills developed during their PE lessons. It fosters healthy competition through a variety of events, ranging from individual challenges such as throwing at targets to class-based competitions such as modified Netball and Volleyball.
The Sports Carnival serves as an authentic learning context where students put the Valourian hallmarks into practice through every game, activity and challenge: 
* **Grit** - not giving up
* **Courage** – playing their best for their class
*	**Kindness and Empathy** – showing care and respect for others
*	**Adaptability** – adjusting to different levels and challenges in play 

**Outdoor Adventure Learning Camps**

Our annual Primary 3 Sleepover Camp and the Primary 4 Outdoor Adventure Learning Cohort Camp provide our students with unique experiential learning opportunities beyond the classroom. In line with MOE’s Outdoor Education goals, students build outdoor competencies and confidence through authentic learning experiences such as camps. 

Through carefully planned activities such as outdoor orienteering and team-building challenges, students are encouraged to step out of their comfort zones, overcome challenges and strengthen bonds with their peers. The camps also deepen students’ appreciation of nature while cultivating essential life skills and values. 

By the end of the camps, students gain memorable experiences and grow as confident individuals, ready to take on future challenges with resilience and courage.
