<h3>Focus and Beliefs</h3>
<p>The Aesthetics department strives to cultivate a vibrant arts culture
where students inspire and learn from one another, celebrating each child’s
creative expression. We aim to provide every student with opportunities
to collaborate, grow, and thrive together through the learning, creation,
and appreciation of diverse forms of the arts.</p>
<p>In addition to the MOE Art and Music Syllabus, our students also build
essential 21st-century skills and attitudes by inspiring thinking, connection,
communication and confidence through the following Art &amp; Music programmes:</p>
